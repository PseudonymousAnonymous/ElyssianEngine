# ElyssianEngine
A very, very, very bad 3D renderer using no hardware acceleration and formats that should have died off long ago
The goal is to make a piece of software that even the most noobie of noob programmers can look at and go, "Oh yeah, that makes sense", and not have to struggle with a PDF on one monitor and Visual Studio on the other
It will not be comprehensive or even decent, but it will work and should be designed to be able to be used in anthing, given enough tweaking and time
